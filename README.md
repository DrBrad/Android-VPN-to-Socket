VPN to Socket
===========

Quick and easy VPN to Socket using packet manipulation. Create proxys and firewalls easily globally!

How can I create a proxy or firewall within this library? 
-----------
All you need to do is modify the ```VPN/Proxy.java``` file.
[Proxy.java](https://github.com/DrBrad/Android-VPN-to-Socket/blob/master/app/src/main/java/vpntosocket/shadowrouter/org/vpntosocket/VPN/Proxy.java)

This project only converts traffic into a Socket then relays data. You may inject or modify the in/out if you wish. If you want to proxy data via SOCKS using this method I recommend trying my other project. https://github.com/DrBrad/JTun2Socks Its basically the same project however I have added the SOCKS5 protocol for you.
